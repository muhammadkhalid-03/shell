# Shell Program - README

This project is a command-line shell written in C. The shell allows users to run standard system commands, manage background processes, and handle basic input/output redirection. It also provides built-in commands like `cd` to change directories and `exit` to terminate the shell.

## Features

- Execute standard system commands (e.g. `ls`, `echo`)
- Support for background execution using `&` (e.g., `sleep 10 &`)
- Built-in commands:
  - `cd <directory>`: Change the working directory
  - `exit`: Exit the shell
